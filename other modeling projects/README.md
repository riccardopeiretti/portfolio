### [ AIS-Based Predictive Modeling of Vessel Trajectories ](AIS_Based_Predictive_Modeling_of_Vessel_Trajectories.pdf)
- **Objective:** Predict the future positions of vessels up to five days ahead using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, integrating vessel characteristics, navigation status, and port information.  

- **Achievements:** Conducted exploratory data analysis and feature engineering (lags, time differences, distance and bearing to port); implemented predictive models with Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The best-performing models leveraged temporal and spatial features (latitude/longitude lags, moving averages) to improve trajectory forecasting accuracy, highlighting both the potential and limitations of AIS data for maritime traffic prediction.

### [ Knowledge Graphs and Transportation Optimization ](Knowledge_Graphs_and_Transportation_Optimization.pdf)
- **Objective:** Build a Knowledge Graph (KG) to integrate public transportation data (urban, extra-urban, trains, buses) with educational facilities in Trentino, aiming to optimize students’ and professors’ commutes from regional and national locations.  

- **Achievements:** Collected and integrated heterogeneous datasets (GTFS, open data, PDFs, scraped sources); formalized the purpose with personas, competency questions, and ER models; designed and implemented a teleontology aligned with existing ontologies (GTFS, Schema.org, Datascientia LiveKnowledge); produced and evaluated a reusable KG enabling queries about optimal transportation routes for different user profiles.

### [ On Recommendation Systems in Logistics ](On_Recommendation_Systems_in_Logistics.pdf)
- **Objective:** Explore the application of recommendation systems within the logistics domain, focusing on optimizing drivers’ route choices through data mining and machine learning techniques.  

- **Achievements:** Designed and tested different approaches including collaborative filtering (user-user, item-item), content-based filtering, and hybrid systems. Leveraged Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and clustering (K-means) to improve performance and scalability. The work demonstrated the feasibility of personalized and system-wide route recommendations, significantly outperforming baseline heuristics in both quality and efficiency.
