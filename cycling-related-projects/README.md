### [ Calorie Estimation for Cyclists ](Calorie_Estimation_for_Cyclists.pdf)
- **Objective:** Propose a machine learning approach to estimate a cyclist's caloric needs during training, using body metrics, historical ride data, and training plans.  

- **Achievements:** Designed the concept of a Random Forest regression model using a simulated dataset, outlining validation strategies with MAE and RMSE; the proposed system envisions integration with wearable devices and platforms such as Strava/Garmin, with accuracy requirements of ≥85% and full GDPR compliance.  

### [ Predictive Model for Cycling ](Predictive_Model_for_Cycling.pdf) 
- **Objective:** Develop a supervised machine learning model to predict riders' results in each stage of the Tour de France 2023, using historical Grand Tour data (2017–2022) and stage/rider characteristics.  

- **Achievements:** Implemented and evaluated two predictive models with XGBoost:  
  - *Time prediction model* (R² ≈ 0.90) accurately estimated stage completion times.  
  - *Position prediction model* (R² ≈ 0.26) partially predicted rankings, highlighting the complexity of rider-specific outcomes. 

  The thesis identified major challenges (data quality, tactics, injuries, weather) and proposed improvements through richer feature integration. 

### [ Product Development for Safety in Cycling ](Product_Development_for_Safety_in_Cycling.pdf)
- **Objective:** Design and prototype an innovative smart helmet (E-Helmet) and companion mobile app to enhance cyclists’ road safety.  

- **Achievements:** Conducted user research through surveys, interviews, and field observations; defined personas and scenarios; developed and evaluated low- and medium-fidelity prototypes. Key features include brain–computer interface for automatic turn signals, accident detection, head-up display, and integration with fitness apps. Usability testing showed strong results (SUS ≈ 85, ~94% task completion).
